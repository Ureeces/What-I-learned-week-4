# What I learned week 5

`boolean` - booleans can have the values `true` or `false`, and are the truth variables of Javascript

They are core foundation for comparison logic, and will be extremely useful for `if` and `else` statements

### String methods

`str.substring(beginIndex, endIndex)` - returns a new string that begins with the character at the beginIndex and ends at the character at the index before endIndex

### Not going to spoil anything, but I have learned a lot for loops within Javascript
